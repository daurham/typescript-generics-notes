# Typescript Generics

Following along with Ben Awad, I reviewed and took notes on Typescript Generics.
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nViEqpgwxHE)

## What I Learned:
- Generics are usually for dynaimcally passing in values that you don't know / can't predict. 
- In a sense you're defining the generic range of values something can be / accept.  
- If you watch alongside the video, I urge you to recreate and document your own notes.

## Reviewing The Code:
1. Clone repo
2. Install deps
```
npm i
```

3. Run Typescript
```
npm run ts
```

4. Mess around


NOTE: React doesnt work, its just for TS to read.
